        <h4>About Me</h4>
        
        <p>I am a senior at Duke University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ksm/">Kristin Stephens-Martinez</a>.  
          <br>
          My research is in Computer Science Education (CSEd), and my senior thesis examines the relationship between student modality, discussion, and learning from peer instruction across modalities of hybrid courses.
          However, I am more broadly interested in active learning pedagogy.
          Additionally, I am interested in providing equitable access to CS education and exploring how studentsâ€™ classroom experiences are influenced by aspects of their identity. 
          My prior works examined the differences between UTA and student diversity at Duke and evaluated their relationship to student performance and persistence in the CS major. 
          In the future, I hope to also explore factors that influence student sense of belonging and self-efficacy.
      </p>
      <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy crocheting, testing out different matcha recipes, and playing the flute in the Duke University Marching Band.
